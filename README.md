Overview
------------

End-of-game score calculator for the board game Imperial.

Basically a "Hello World" experiment to see if I could write a decent app using PhoneGap, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.

The webapp itself is hosted [here][2].

The Android source code is [here][3].

Testing
-------------

Install Karma and simply run:

```
karma start test/karma.conf.js
```
